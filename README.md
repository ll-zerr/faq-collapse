## Features

- View various cards that hold common questions.
- Reveal the answer to each specific question by clicking the button.
- Hide the answer to that specific question by clicking the button again.

## Technologies Used

- HTML5
- CSS3
- JavaScript

## My Process

- Start the files from a boiler template.
- Create containers to display each question, the corresponding answer, and the buttons for toggling.
- Add styles for the containers.
- Create a variable for the target element.
- Add an event listener to each button using the forEach() method.
- Apply the active class with the toggle() method to the container that holds the button the user has clicked.

### Continued development

This was the first time I have utilized icons in the CSS styling with the icon Unicode. I appreciate the simplicity of this approach and will likely implement this knowledge in future projects.
